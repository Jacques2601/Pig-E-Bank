# Pig E. Bank – Customer Retention & Risk Analysis

This project was conducted as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program. The objective was to explore customer attrition patterns and identify high-risk profiles to support Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts and strengthen customer retention strategies for a global financial institution.

## Project Objective

Pig E. Bank wanted to proactively reduce customer churn and identify patterns that may signal financial risk or fraudulent behavior. This analysis combined exploratory techniques with predictive modeling to generate actionable insights into client behavior, retention, and risk segmentation.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, pivot tables, regression modeling, decision tree construction  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – Data wrangling, risk factor flagging, visualization  
- **Data Source**: Simulated dataset provided by CareerFoundry

## Process Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
   Cleaned and explored customer demographic and account data to assess churn-related patterns.

2. **Risk Segmentation & Modeling**  
   Applied regression and classification logic (including a decision tree) to flag high-risk customers based on factors like age, gender, account activity, and number of products.

3. **Insight Generation**  
   Used Excel and Python to surface key churn indicators and visualize customer profiles at risk of leaving or engaging in high-risk activity.

## Key Insights

- **60% of customers who left** were aged **40–59**.  
- **70% of churned clients** had **no membership status**.  
- **Female customers** had a higher attrition rate compared to males.  
- High balances without product diversity raised potential **AML concerns**.

## Recommendations

- Develop **personalized financial products** for mid-aged female customers.
- Launch a **loyalty program** to encourage membership and product usage.
- Closely monitor high-balance accounts with low engagement to identify possible fraud risks.
